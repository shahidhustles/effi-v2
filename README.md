# Effi v2

Effi turns natural civic reports into evidence-backed cases officers can act on.

A citizen reports an issue through Telegram, WhatsApp, or the Expo app. Effi confirms the report, stores it in Convex, and gives it a report number. An officer opens the case in the dashboard, inspects the evidence, and moves it through resolution.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or later
- Corepack (`corepack enable`)
- A Convex deployment with Clerk configured for the dashboard, the app, and the gateway
- OpenCode Zen access for the bot gateway model; the start script reads the credential from `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`
- `ngrok` for the Telegram webhook

## Local setup

```sh
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install
```

Copy each `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill it in. The dashboard, app, gateway, and Convex deployment each have their own values. Keep them out of Git.

## Services

```sh
corepack pnpm --filter @effi/backend convex:dev          # Convex functions and schema
corepack pnpm --filter @effi/officer-dashboard dev       # officer dashboard, port 3000
corepack pnpm --filter @effi/citizen-app android         # Expo app on a device or emulator
./scripts/effi-bot.sh start                              # bot gateway and tunnel
./scripts/effi-bot.sh webhook                            # register the Telegram webhook
```
